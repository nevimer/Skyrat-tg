## Rules

- If a map consists of multiple z-levels, each z-level should be a separate dmm file rather than one dmm with multiple z-levels.
Reason: MapDiffBot is unable to load dmms with multiple z-levels within it. This makes viewing changes needlessly difficult.

- Modular (Skyrat-exclusive) station-maps should aim to only be one z-level; if the map creator is going to use more than one z-level, the maximum amount of z-levels for the station will be two.
Reason: There can be issues when multiple z-levels are considered station-level z-levels; additionally, more station z-levels means less space z-levels.
