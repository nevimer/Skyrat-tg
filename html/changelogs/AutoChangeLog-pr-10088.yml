  - balance: "Doing surgery on somebody without first making them unconscious now leaves them with a lingering mood penalty. The mood penalty's time and intensity can be reduced with numbing agents like copious amounts of alcohol, Miner's Salve, Lidocaine, and Morphine _if used prior to surgery._"
  - rscadd: "Roboticists can now purchase two forms of anesthetic in their job wardrobe vendors (N2O gas/morphine.)"
