changes: 
  - rscadd: "Added a whole new load of security drip, including gauntlets, new HuDs/NV HuDs, new tackler gloves/Krav Maga gloves, remodeled visor helmets (which fit muzzles now!), boot reskins, a blue belt, and a white uniform. Security are also unable to spawn with skirts now as well, seeing as they have no peacekeeper sprite.
qol: The Peacekeeper Outfitting Station has had a new model shipped out by Lopland themselves, giving Peacekeepers all the uniforms they'll ever need. This has replaced all old P.O.S's"
  - bugfix: "Metastation's lockerroom-to-firingrange door has been fixed. Again."
  - bugfix: "Security's helmet lights should stop being weird whenever their visor is toggled
qol: Security reskins can now be set to the default skin; no more radial menu spam on your black belts!"
