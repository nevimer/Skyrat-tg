## Map resetting /TG/ maps


TG maps do periodically need to be reset to what they are upstream. 
In the event some major repathing occurs, which would otherwise render the map useless, the maps will need to be reset. Some **CRITICAL** things need to be brought over. These **CRITICAL** things are necessary  for the flow of the game and round, in other words, they're **ROUND CRITICAL**. 

When preforming a reset, make sure to update the `readme.md` in `_maps\map_files\` with what you have done. This can include resetting the maps, resetting TGs maps, editing a map to make it compliant.

Please keep in mind we have templates to help make map resets more streamlined and easier. They're not fool proof, and still **REQUIRE** you to map in some minor things that don't themselves warrant their own templates.

If you NEED to update and/or edit something that may be a template, MAKE SURE TO EDIT THE TEMPLATE TOO. Failure to do so will result in any changes you made to be lost in map resets. When in doubt, ask the maptainers or maintainers for help.
